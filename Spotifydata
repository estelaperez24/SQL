- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
- Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
- Finally, I performed some analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

- I determined who the Top 10 artists are by popularity
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10

- I selected which songs had an energy > 0.8 and duration < 200000
SELECT track_name, energy, duration_ms 
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE energy>0.8
AND duration_ms<200000

- I selected which songs were by Olivia Rodrigo
SELECT artist_name, track_name
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='Olivia Rodrigo'
